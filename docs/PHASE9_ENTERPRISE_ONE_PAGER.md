# Enterprise-Grade Governance Infrastructure

**One-Page Summary for Sales & Enterprise**

---

## Headline

**Enterprise-Grade Governance Infrastructure**

Built-in controls and evidence to support security reviews, compliance, and enterprise procurement.

---

## Capabilities

- **Tamper-evident audit** — Every admin action is logged in an append-only chain; integrity is verifiable via hash chain and optional daily signed snapshots. No silent edits or deletes.

- **Segregation of duties** — Role-based access (RBAC) with distinct permissions; no single role holds all powers. High-impact actions can require a second authority.

- **4-eyes destructive control** — Configurable approval workflow for destructive or sensitive actions (e.g. user delete, anonymize, bulk operations). Request → approve/reject with full audit trail.

- **Continuous monitoring** — Daily control-health checks (RBAC consistency, chain validity, escalation age, session anomalies, overdue data requests). Per-control status and 0–100 score; overall governance score for boards and auditors.

- **Escalation + SLA enforcement** — Automatic escalations when metrics cross thresholds (e.g. pending items, overdue data requests, session anomalies). Open escalations aged beyond a defined window surface in control health and risk views.

- **Evidence-on-demand exports** — Audit log export (CSV), chain verification, escalation and session summaries, and evidence registry tied to control codes (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR). One-click generation and storage of evidence records for diligence and audits.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise procurement** — Demonstrate concrete controls and evidence paths instead of generic claims.
- **Investor due diligence** — Fast-track answers with exact endpoints and export types.
- **SOC 2 / ISO 27001 readiness** — Mapped controls and repeatable evidence generation.
- **Board reporting** — Overall governance score and control status without operational detail.
