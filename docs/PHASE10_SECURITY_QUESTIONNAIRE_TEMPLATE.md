## How do you manage admin access?

Admin access is allowlisted (e.g. by environment) and scoped by role. Roles (e.g. viewer, moderator, supervisor, compliance, super_admin) have defined permissions. No one has full power by default; roles are assigned explicitly. Assignments and changes are logged. At least one super_admin is enforced; conflicting combinations (e.g. moderator and super_admin for the same user) are detected by control health checks.

---

## How is audit logging protected?

Every admin action is written to an append-only audit table. Each row includes a hash of its content and the previous row’s hash, forming a chain. Altering or deleting any row breaks the chain. We run verification regularly; optional daily snapshots sign the latest chain hash. The audit table does not support row deletion. Export is permission-gated (e.g. export_audit).

---

## How do you prevent unauthorized destructive actions?

Destructive or sensitive actions (e.g. user deletion, anonymization, bulk operations) require the corresponding permission. They can also be gated by a 4-eyes approval workflow: one person requests, another (e.g. supervisor or super_admin) approves or rejects. Requests and outcomes are stored and audited. Rate limits can apply to destructive actions.

---

## How do you detect anomalies?

We track operational metrics (pending reports, overdue data requests, session anomalies, governance review overdue). When a threshold is exceeded, an escalation is created. New admin sessions from a different IP for the same user can trigger an audit event and optional escalation. Daily control health checks evaluate RBAC consistency, audit chain validity, escalation age, and other controls; status and score are stored and visible in the Compliance dashboard.

---

## How do you handle data subject requests?

Data subject requests (e.g. export, deletion) are tracked in a dedicated table with status and age. Overdue pending requests feed into control health and escalation. Processing is documented in the audit log where applicable. Overdue counts are used in continuous control monitoring (e.g. GDPR Art 30–oriented checks).

---

## How do you produce evidence for audits?

We map controls to framework criteria (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR). Evidence can be generated by control code: audit export (CSV), chain verification, escalation summary, session summary, approval summary, data request summary. Each generation is recorded in an evidence registry with timestamp and reference. Reproduce instructions are available per control. Control health (overall score and per-control status) is available via secure API and Compliance dashboard.
