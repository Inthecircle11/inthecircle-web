**Slide: Operational Governance as Competitive Moat**

## Slide title

**Operational Governance as Competitive Moat**

---

## Body (short paragraph)

We’ve built governance into the product: segregation of duties, 4-eyes approval for destructive actions, tamper-evident audit logging, session monitoring, continuous control monitoring, and evidence-on-demand for SOC 2 / ISO / GDPR–oriented attestation. That gives us **faster enterprise close cycles** (we can answer security questionnaires with specific APIs and exports), **reduced regulatory risk** (controls and evidence exist today, not only on paper), **higher diligence readiness** (investors and acquirers see concrete controls and health scoring), and a **structural advantage vs. competitors** who rely on policy and manual evidence gathering. Governance is a differentiator in enterprise sales and in valuation.

## Optional bullets

- Faster enterprise close: specific answers and evidence paths shorten security reviews.
- Reduced regulatory risk: implemented controls and verifiable audit chain.
- Higher diligence readiness: control mapping and health score available for investors and acquirers.
- Structural advantage: governance infrastructure in product vs. policy-only or post-hoc compliance.
