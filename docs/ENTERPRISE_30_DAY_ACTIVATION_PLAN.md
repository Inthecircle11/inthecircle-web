## SECTION 1 — ICP Definition

### Ideal Enterprise Profile

| Dimension | Definition |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Industry** | Regulated or compliance-sensitive: financial services, healthcare-adjacent, edtech, SaaS selling to enterprises, government contractors, media/entertainment with data obligations. |
| **Size** | Mid-market to enterprise: 200–5,000+ employees, or high-revenue SMB (e.g. $10M+ ARR) with procurement and security review. |
| **Compliance sensitivity** | SOC 2, ISO 27001, or GDPR in scope; security questionnaire part of vendor onboarding; or M&A/diligence in horizon. |
| **Pain triggers** | Long security review cycles; “we need to run you through our process”; procurement asking for evidence and control documentation; past vendor incidents or audit findings. |
| **Decision makers** | **Champion:** Head of Ops, Compliance Lead, or CTO. **Influencer:** Security/Infosec, Procurement. **Economic:** CFO, COO. **Blocker:** Legal/Privacy if not addressed early. |

### ICP Summary Statement

*Enterprise or compliance-sensitive mid-market accounts where security review is a known gate, and where governance maturity (Trust Center, evidence-on-demand, control health) can shorten cycles and differentiate.*

## SECTION 2 — Outreach System

### Governance-led intro message (use in email + LinkedIn)

**One-liner:**  
“We built institutional-grade governance before scale — RBAC, 4-eyes approval, tamper-evident audit, continuous control monitoring. Security review rarely blocks our deals because we can show controls and evidence live.”

**Short version:**  
“We designed for enterprise procurement: public Trust Center, evidence by control code, live control health. Happy to walk your team through in 20 minutes.”

---

### Cold email 1 — Head of Operations

**Subject:** Fewer fires — governance built in from day one

Hi [First],

You’re balancing ops at scale with risk. We built our admin layer with segregation of duties, 4-eyes approval for destructive actions, tamper-evident audit, and continuous control monitoring — so we’re not chasing policy after the fact.

We have a public Trust Center and a live control health view. I’d be happy to show you in 15 minutes and see if it’s relevant for how you evaluate vendors.

### Cold email 2 — Compliance Lead

**Subject:** Controls and evidence in product, not only in policy docs

Hi [First],

Your team needs answers and exports, not promises. We have role segregation, 4-eyes approval, tamper-evident audit chain, session monitoring, and evidence-on-demand by control code (SOC 2 / ISO / GDPR). Trust Center is public; control health is in-admin.

Can we walk through your checklist and show you exactly what we can produce?

### Cold email 3 — CTO

**Subject:** Governance infra that doesn’t block ship

Hi [First],

RBAC, tamper-evident audit, 4-eyes for destructive ops — all in-app. No “we’ll add it post-sale.” We have a Trust Center and a control health API so your security review can validate, not discover.

15 minutes to show you the structure?

### LinkedIn outreach script

**Connection request (with note):**  
“[First], we’re focused on enterprise governance — RBAC, 4-eyes, tamper-evident audit, evidence on demand. If your team runs security reviews on vendors, I’d be glad to share how we’re built for that. [Your name]”

**Follow-up (after accept):**  
“Thanks for connecting. Quick context: we built institutional governance into the product from day one — public Trust Center, evidence by control code, live control health. If you’d find it useful, I can send the Trust Center link and a one-pager, or we can do a 20-min walkthrough. No pitch unless it’s a fit.”

---

## SECTION 3 — Call Structure

### 30-minute enterprise discovery

| Block | Time | Content |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Intro + agenda** | 0–2 min | Confirm who’s on the call; “I’d like to spend a few minutes on how we handle governance, then understand your priorities and where we might fit.” |
| **Governance intro** | 2–12 min | Use discovery script: designed with institutional governance from day one; security review rarely blocks; we can walk their team through controls live. Mention: Trust Center (public), evidence-on-demand, control health. No deep dive — structure only. |
| **Transition** | 12–13 min | “That’s how we’re built. What does your security or procurement process look like today, and where do vendors usually get stuck?” |
| **Discovery** | 13–22 min | Pain: review length, questionnaire volume, evidence requests. Stakeholders: who owns security review, who signs. Timeline: when they need to close, any hard deadlines. |
| **Product fit** | 22–27 min | Tie their use case to product (no new features). “Given that, here’s how we’d fit…” Keep it short. |
| **Close** | 27–30 min | Next step: “Send Trust Center + one-pager + FAQ”; “Schedule 20-min governance walkthrough for your security/compliance”; or “Introduce procurement — we’ll send the Procurement Compression Kit.” Confirm owner and date. |

### Where governance is introduced

- **First 10 minutes:** Governance is the lead. Frame: institutional design, review rarely blocks, live walkthrough available.
- **After 10 min:** Transition with one question: “What does your security/procurement process look like, and where do vendors usually get stuck?”

### How to transition to product

- **Bridge:** “That’s the governance side. In terms of what we actually do for you…” then 2–3 sentences on product value (outcomes, not features).
- **Rule:** Governance opens the door; product closes the fit. If they only want governance proof, next step = walkthrough + Procurement Compression Kit. If they want product, add discovery questions and tailor next steps.

---

## SECTION 4 — Procurement Compression Kit

### After first call (within 24 hours)

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Trust Center link** | Single reference for governance architecture, access control, audit, 4-eyes, incident, session, monitoring, DSAR, compliance, contact. |
| **Enterprise Security Deck** (or one-pager) | 8–10 slide deck or condensed one-pager: governance overview, RBAC, 4-eyes, tamper-evident audit, continuous monitoring, evidence on demand, operational maturity. |
| **FAQ (one-page)** | Logging, role segregation, data request SLAs, incident response, audit exports, session governance. Use Security Questionnaire content in short form. |

**Email line:** “As discussed, here’s our Trust Center, governance deck [or one-pager], and a one-page FAQ. Happy to schedule a 20-min walkthrough for your security or compliance team.”

---

### When security review starts

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Security Questionnaire** | Full Q&A: admin access, audit protection, destructive-action prevention, anomaly detection, data subject requests, evidence for audits. |
| **Evidence-on-demand offer** | “We can generate evidence by control code — audit export, chain verification, escalation/session/approval summaries. Tell us your framework (SOC 2 / ISO / GDPR) and we’ll align.” |
| **Governance walkthrough** | Live 20–30 min: Trust Center, audit chain, 4-eyes flow, Governance Health dashboard. Invite security/compliance. |
| **Sample evidence pack** (if allowed) | Redacted audit CSV or chain verification output + reproduce instructions. Shows format and rigor. |

**Email line:** “Now that security review is starting, we’ve attached our security questionnaire answers. We can also do a live walkthrough of our controls and produce evidence by control code for your framework. When’s a good time for your team?”

---

### When CFO (or COO) joins

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Executive framing** | Risk discount reduction, operational predictability, institutional readiness, scalable oversight. Use language from Enterprise Risk Compression / Investor Narrative. |
| **Trust Center + FAQ** | Same as first call; CFO/COO may not have seen them. |
| **One slide or short doc** | “Designed for enterprise procurement and regulated environments” + 4 bullets: segregation of duties, 4-eyes, tamper-evident audit, evidence on demand. Optional: governance score snapshot (e.g. “Governance Health: 92/100”) if shareable. |

**Email line:** “For [CFO/COO]: we’re built for enterprise procurement — here’s our Trust Center and a short overview. Our governance model is in the product, so security review tends to be validation, not discovery. Happy to join a call if helpful.”

---

## SECTION 5 — 30-Day Execution Plan

### Week 1 — Outreach & first calls

| KPI | Target | Notes |
|-----|--------|------|
| **Outreach targets** | 40–60 | Mix: cold email (Ops / Compliance / CTO) + LinkedIn. ICP only. |
| **Calls goal** | 8–12 | 30-min discovery calls. Governance intro in first 10 min; set next step (Trust Center + deck + FAQ, or walkthrough). |
| **Next-step rate** | ≥50% | Share Trust Center + one-pager + FAQ or book walkthrough. |

**Actions:** Load ICP list; send 3 email variants + LinkedIn script; book discovery calls; send Procurement Compression Kit (Trust Center, deck, FAQ) within 24h of each call.

**Risk mitigation:** If no list, use existing pipeline first — tag “enterprise” or “compliance-sensitive” and run same play. If reply rate is low, A/B subject lines and shorten email body.

---

### Week 2 — Security walkthroughs

| KPI | Target | Notes |
|-----|--------|------|
| **Governance walkthroughs** | 4–6 | 20–30 min with security/compliance. Show Trust Center, audit chain, 4-eyes, Governance Health. |
| **Security questionnaire sends** | 4–6 | Send full Security Questionnaire to anyone in review or who asked for documentation. |
| **Evidence-on-demand mentions** | 4–6 | In every walkthrough or review thread: “We can produce evidence by control code.” |

**Actions:** From Week 1 pipeline, book walkthroughs; send questionnaire when review starts; offer sample evidence pack where appropriate.

**Risk mitigation:** If prospects delay review, use “We can do the walkthrough before you start — so when you do, you already have the story” to pull forward.

---

### Week 3 — Procurement threads

| KPI | Target | Notes |
|-----|--------|------|
| **Procurement threads opened** | 3–5 | Explicit “we’re in security/procurement review” or “procurement has been looped in.” |
| **Control-mapping / evidence requests** | 2–4 | Map their questions to SOC 2 / ISO / GDPR; send evidence by control code or reproduce steps. |
| **CFO/COO touchpoints** | 1–2 | Send executive framing + Trust Center + one-pager when economic buyer joins. |

**Actions:** Identify deals in review; send Procurement Compression Kit (questionnaire, evidence offer, walkthrough); add CFO/COO asset when they enter.

**Risk mitigation:** If procurement is slow, champion-led internal share: “Send this to your security team” (Trust Center + FAQ) to create internal pull.

---

### Week 4 — Proposals & close

| KPI | Target | Notes |
|-----|--------|------|
| **Proposals sent** | 2–4 | Formal proposal or commercial offer to accounts that completed discovery + walkthrough and have no open governance blockers. |
| **Open governance blockers** | 0 for proposals | No proposal until security/procurement has Trust Center, questionnaire, and evidence path. |
| **Pipeline created** | 12–20 | Total qualified enterprise opportunities with next step (call, walkthrough, or proposal). |

**Actions:** Propose only to deals where governance has been addressed; use “Designed for enterprise procurement and regulated environments” in proposal or exec summary. Track pipeline and carry forward into next 30 days.

**Risk mitigation:** If proposals slip, treat “governance approved / no blockers” as a stage — move only when security/procurement has what they need.

---

## Risk mitigation tactics

| Risk | Tactic |
|------|--------|
| Low reply rate | Shorten emails; lead with one benefit; A/B subject lines. Use LinkedIn for compliance/CTO. |
| “We’re not ready for security review yet” | “We can do the walkthrough now so when you’re ready, you already have the story and the links.” |
| Long procurement cycles | Send Trust Center + FAQ to champion to share internally; create internal pull. |
| Competitor in the deal | Use competitive trap questions (tamper-evident? 4-eyes? evidence by control? continuous monitoring?). |
| No enterprise list | Start with existing pipeline; tag by industry/size; run same play on 20–30 accounts. |
| Governance not prioritised | Lead with pain: “Do security reviews usually slow your vendor onboarding?” Then offer Trust Center + walkthrough. |
