Slide-by-slide content ready for Google Slides or Figma.

## Slide 1 — Title

**Enterprise-Grade Governance & Control Infrastructure**

*Subtitle (optional):* Built for enterprise procurement and regulated environments.

## Slide 2 — Governance Architecture Overview

**Governance Architecture Overview**

*Visual structure (flow or diagram):*

1. **RBAC** — Role-based access; distinct permissions per role.
2. **4-eyes approval** — High-impact actions require request → approve by second authority.
3. **Tamper-evident audit** — Append-only, hash-chained log; verification and optional snapshots.
4. **Escalations** — Threshold-based; open items aged; SLA enforcement.
5. **Session governance** — New-session detection; revocable sessions; anomaly audit.
6. **Continuous control monitoring** — Daily health checks; governance score; per-control status.

*Note for design:* Use a simple horizontal or vertical flow (boxes + arrows). No jargon in labels.

## Slide 3 — Access Control & Segregation of Duties

**Access Control & Segregation of Duties**

- **Role-based access control.** Defined roles (e.g. viewer, moderator, supervisor, compliance, super_admin) with explicit permissions. No implicit full access.
- **No single role has unrestricted destructive power.** Destructive actions require specific permission and, where configured, a second approval.
- **Role assignments are audited.** Every assignment and change is logged; who changed what, when.
- **Drift detection.** Control health checks flag conflicts (e.g. same user with incompatible roles), unexpected role changes, and config drift. Issues surface in the governance dashboard.

---

## Slide 4 — Destructive Action Control (4-Eyes)

**Destructive Action Control (4-Eyes)**

- **Approval workflow.** Destructive or sensitive actions (e.g. user deletion, anonymization, bulk operations) follow request → approve/reject by a second authority (e.g. supervisor or super_admin). No single actor can both request and approve.
- **Threshold-based bulk controls.** Bulk actions can be gated by limits and approval. Reduces risk of accidental or malicious mass change.
- **No single-actor deletion.** Where 4-eyes is enabled, deletion requires a distinct approver. Request and outcome are stored and audited.
- **Audit trail.** Every request, approval, and rejection is in the tamper-evident audit log with timestamp and actor.

---

## Slide 5 — Tamper-Evident Audit Infrastructure

**Tamper-Evident Audit Infrastructure**

- **Append-only log.** All admin actions are written to an audit table. Rows are not updated or deleted. History is preserved.
- **Hash chain.** Each row includes a hash of its content and the previous row’s hash. Altering or deleting any row breaks the chain. Verification detects tampering.
- **Snapshot verification.** Optional daily snapshots sign the latest chain hash. Independent verification can confirm integrity for a point in time.
- **Export capability.** Audit export (e.g. CSV) is permission-gated. Exports are recorded in the evidence registry. Reproduce instructions are available.

---

## Slide 6 — Continuous Control Monitoring

**Continuous Control Monitoring**

- **Daily health checks.** Automated checks run against RBAC consistency, audit chain validity, escalation age, session anomalies, overdue data requests, and other controls. Results are stored and visible.
- **Governance score.** An overall score (e.g. 0–100) and per-control status give a quick view of control health. No manual attestation required for current state.
- **Escalations for drift or SLA breach.** When metrics cross thresholds (e.g. overdue items, open escalations past SLA), new escalations are created. Open items surface in the dashboard and in the score.
- **Session anomaly detection.** New admin sessions from a different IP (or similar signals) are audited and can trigger escalation. Supports detection of compromised or misuse scenarios.

---

## Slide 7 — Data Subject & Incident Handling

**Data Subject & Incident Handling**

- **Data request tracking.** Data subject requests (e.g. export, deletion) are tracked in a dedicated store with status and age. Processing is documented in the audit log where applicable.
- **Overdue detection.** Overdue pending requests feed into control health and escalation. Overdue counts are visible in the governance dashboard and affect the overall score.
- **Escalation model.** Thresholds (e.g. max age for open requests) drive automatic escalations. Open escalations are aged and surfaced for follow-up. Supports SLA discipline.
- **Evidence retention.** Request lifecycle, approvals, and exports are audited. Evidence can be generated by control code for audits (e.g. GDPR Art 30–oriented).

---

## Slide 8 — Evidence on Demand

**Evidence on Demand**

- **Control mapping (SOC 2 / ISO / GDPR).** Controls are mapped to framework criteria. Evidence generation is aligned to control codes, not ad hoc.
- **Generate evidence by control code.** For each control, we can produce the relevant evidence: audit export, chain verification, escalation summary, session summary, approval summary, data request summary. One pack per control or per framework area.
- **CSV exports.** Audit log and other datasets are available as CSV (permission-gated). Exports are logged in the evidence registry with timestamp and reference.
- **Reproduce instructions.** Each evidence type has documented steps to reproduce. Auditors and internal teams can re-run verification or regenerate exports.

---

## Slide 9 — Operational Maturity

**Operational Maturity**

- **Built before scale.** Governance (RBAC, 4-eyes, tamper-evident audit, continuous monitoring) was designed into the platform from the start. Not added after the fact to satisfy a single deal.
- **Designed for procurement.** Public Trust Center, one-pager, FAQ, evidence-on-demand, and live control health support the review process. Security review is validation, not discovery.
- **Institutional governance from day one.** The same control model and evidence paths apply to all environments. No “enterprise mode” versus “standard”; one standard is institutional.

---

## Slide 10 — Close

**Designed for enterprise procurement and regulated environments.**

*Optional subline:* Trust Center, evidence on demand, control health dashboard. We can walk your team through controls live.
