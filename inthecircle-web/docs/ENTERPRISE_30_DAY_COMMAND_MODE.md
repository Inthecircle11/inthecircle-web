# 30-Day Enterprise Command Mode

Ensure the founder executes daily without energy fluctuation and maintains enterprise urgency.

---

## SECTION 1 — Command Metrics

**Only 3 numbers that matter daily.**

| # | Metric | Daily minimum | Why it matters |
|---|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **1** | **Outreach** | 6 | Pipeline is built or it isn’t. No outreach = no pipeline. Non-negotiable floor. |
| **2** | **Calls** | 1 | At least one live conversation (discovery or walkthrough). Moves deals; creates next steps. |
| **3** | **Next steps set** | 2 | Every active deal has a concrete next step with owner and date. Prevents stall. |

**Rule:** If the day ends without hitting all three, the day is incomplete. Log before closing.

**Not in the 3:** Replies, proposals, wins — they are outcomes. The 3 are inputs you control every day.

---

## SECTION 2 — Governance Positioning Rule

**Strict rule:** Governance must be introduced in every discovery call. No exception.

### Exact 2-minute script

*Use a timer. Stay within 2 minutes.*

---

“Before we go into [product/use case], I want to spend two minutes on how we handle governance — it’s what usually shortens security review for our enterprise customers.

**We designed the platform with institutional governance from day one.** That means role segregation, 4-eyes approval for destructive actions, and a tamper-evident audit trail are in the product — not added later. Your security and compliance teams see the same thing we show auditors.

**In practice, security review rarely blocks our deals.** Not because we skip steps — because we already have a public Trust Center, evidence-on-demand by control code, and a live control health view. So the review is validation, not discovery.

**We can walk your team through it live** — Trust Center, audit chain, 4-eyes flow, control health — in about 20 minutes. That often replaces a long questionnaire cycle.

That’s the governance side. What does your security or procurement process look like today — and where do vendors usually get stuck?”

---

**Enforcement:** If you skip this, the call does not count as a completed discovery. Reschedule and run it, or mark the deal as “governance not introduced” and run it on the next call.

---

## SECTION 3 — Deal Momentum Rule

### No deal without next step

- Every deal in the pipeline must have a **next step** (one concrete action) and a **date**.
- “Follow up” is not a next step. “Send Trust Center + FAQ by [date],” “Book walkthrough by [date],” “Send questionnaire by [date]” are.
- At end of each day: any deal without next step gets one before you stop. If you don’t know the next step, the next step is “decide next step and do it by [tomorrow].”

### No deal can stall beyond 5 days

- **Stall** = no meaningful touch (call, email, meeting, asset sent) for 5 calendar days.
- If a deal has had no touch for 3 days, it is **at risk**. Same-day: send one meaningful touch or book the next call.
- If a deal has had no touch for 5 days, it is **stalled**. Next step is mandatory: either one touch that day or move to “stalled” and schedule a recovery action (e.g. “Champion nudge + re-send Trust Center by [date]”).

### Mandatory follow-up cadence

| After | Action | By when |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Discovery call | Send Trust Center + one-pager + FAQ; propose walkthrough | Same day or next morning |
| Walkthrough | Send questionnaire if in review; offer evidence-by-control | Same day or next morning |
| “We’re in security review” | Send questionnaire + evidence offer; set “check-in” date | Within 2 days |
| No reply to outreach | Second touch (different angle or channel) | 4–5 days after first |
| Proposal sent | Check-in (one email or call) | 3–5 days after send |

**Rule:** Cadence overrides “I’ll get to it later.” If the table says “same day,” it’s same day.

---

## SECTION 4 — Energy Protection Rule

### Time block protection

- **Enterprise block:** One contiguous block per day, minimum 90 minutes, for pipeline work only. Calendar it. Same time every day when possible (e.g. 9:00–10:30).
- During this block: outreach, call prep, discovery calls, walkthroughs, next-step updates, scoreboard update. No product work, no internal meetings, no “quick” distractions.
- If a discovery or walkthrough is scheduled outside the block, the block still exists: use it for outreach, follow-ups, and scoreboard.

### No product work before outbound

- **Rule:** First substantive work on pipeline each day must be **outbound or a call** — not product, not strategy, not reading. At least 6 outreach or 1 call before switching to other work.
- Rationale: Energy and clarity go to whatever is done first. Enterprise pipeline loses when product or “urgent” internal work is first.

### No internal distractions before pipeline work

- **Rule:** No internal meetings, no long Slack/email threads, no “quick sync” before the daily pipeline minimum is done (6 outreach + 1 call + 2 next steps set).
- Exception: Customer or prospect call at a fixed time. Then: do outreach and next steps before that call, or immediately after.
- Internal = anything that is not outreach, call, or next-step update for an enterprise deal.

**Summary:** Block protected. Outbound/call before product. No internal before pipeline minimum.

## SECTION 5 — 30-Day Scoreboard

**Simple scoreboard.** One row per day.

| Day | Outreach | Calls | Walkthroughs | Proposals | Wins | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|--------------|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| … | | | | | | |
| 30 | | | | | | |

**Definitions**

- **Outreach:** Number of cold emails or LinkedIn touches sent that day.
- **Calls:** Discovery or walkthrough calls completed.
- **Walkthroughs:** Governance walkthroughs completed (subset of Calls; can be same column or separate for emphasis).
- **Proposals:** Proposals sent that day.
- **Wins:** Deals closed won.
- **Notes:** One line — bottleneck, objection, win, or “hit/miss 3 metrics.”

**Daily use:** Fill before end of day. If Outreach &lt; 6 or Calls &lt; 1 or next steps not set for 2+ deals, note in Notes: “Missed: [which].”

**Weekly:** Sum Outreach, Calls, Walkthroughs, Proposals, Wins. Compare to 30-Day Plan targets. Adjust next week’s daily minimum if needed.

---

## Output Summary

| Deliverable | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| **Command metrics (3 only)** | 1) Outreach ≥6 2) Calls ≥1 3) Next steps set ≥2. Day incomplete if any missed. |
| **Governance rule** | Governance introduced in every discovery. Exact 2-min script provided. Skip = call doesn’t count as discovery. |
| **Deal momentum** | No deal without next step + date. No stall beyond 5 days; 3 days = at risk, same-day touch. Mandatory follow-up cadence table. |
| **Energy protection** | 90-min enterprise block; no product before outbound; no internal before pipeline minimum (6 outreach + 1 call + 2 next steps). |
| **Scoreboard** | Day \| Outreach \| Calls \| Walkthroughs \| Proposals \| Wins \| Notes. Fill daily; weekly sums vs targets. |

---

## Non-negotiable behavioral constraints

1. **The 3 before close:** Every day ends with Outreach ≥6, Calls ≥1, Next steps set ≥2, or the day is logged incomplete.
2. **Governance in every discovery:** 2-minute script run on every discovery call; no exception.
3. **No deal without next step:** Every active deal has one concrete next step with date before you stop.
4. **No stall past 5 days:** At 3 days without touch, same-day touch. At 5 days, recovery action.
5. **Outbound/call before product:** First substantive work each day is pipeline (outreach or call), not product.
6. **No internal before pipeline minimum:** No internal meetings or distraction before 6 outreach + 1 call + 2 next steps set.
7. **Scoreboard filled daily:** Scoreboard updated before end of day; misses noted.

*Command mode is a 30-day commitment. After 30 days, review scoreboard and rules; relax only what is explicitly revised.*
