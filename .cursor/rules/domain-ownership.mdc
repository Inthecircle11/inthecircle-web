# Domain Ownership Rule

**app.inthecircle.co must be attached only to the Vercel project inthecircle-web.** If another project (e.g. "inthecircle") has this domain, visitors see that project's app — different design, different site.

## Do

- Before adding or changing domains, run `npm run verify-domain` (requires VERCEL_TOKEN or `vercel login`).
- **Production deploys** happen by pushing to **`main`** (Git-based). Do not run `vercel deploy --prod` for normal releases.
- If adding a domain in Vercel, add it only to **inthecircle-web**; never add app.inthecircle.co to another project.

## If domain is on the wrong project

Run `./scripts/move-domain-to-inthecircle-web.sh` (requires VERCEL_TOKEN), or in Vercel Dashboard remove app.inthecircle.co from the other project and ensure it is on inthecircle-web.

## See
